# Intro

To whom it may concern:
```
The contents of this repo
  were presented to me,
As a series of Working Papers
  from the School of Geography.
Some of the content is 'content'
  some of the content is meta.
After this workshop, maybe,
  All of this 'stuff' will be better?
```

PS This repo is intended for use in the Day1 workshops at the Open Repositories 2024 conference.
